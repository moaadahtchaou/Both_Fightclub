6. [ ] Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

## Post-Deployment Testing

### ‚úÖ API Endpoints
- [ ] Health check: `GET /api/health`
- [ ] File upload: `POST /upload` (with multipart form data)
- [ ] YouTube download: `GET /download?url=YOUTUBE_URL&type=audio`
- [ ] User endpoints: `GET /api/users` (if applicable)

### ‚úÖ Functionality Tests
- [ ] Admin user creation works
- [ ] Database connection or fallback to memory storage
- [ ] File uploads to Catbox.moe work
- [ ] YouTube downloads work
- [ ] CORS allows your frontend domain

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**‚ùå Database Connection Failed**
- Check MongoDB Atlas connection string
- Verify IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0
- App should fallback to in-memory storage

**‚ùå Function Timeout**
- Check Vercel function logs
- Ensure operations complete within 30 seconds
- Large file operations may need optimization

**‚ùå CORS Errors**
- Add your frontend domain to environment variables
- Check CORS configuration in middleware
- Verify allowed origins in production

**‚ùå Environment Variables Not Found**
- Double-check variable names (case-sensitive)
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check Vercel dashboard settings

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Deployment Successful When:**
- Health endpoint returns 200 status
- Admin user is created (check logs)
- File uploads work without filesystem errors
- YouTube downloads complete successfully
- No CORS errors in browser console

## Security Reminders

üîí **Security Checklist:**
- [ ] Strong JWT secret (32+ characters)
